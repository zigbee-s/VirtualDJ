# Project Title
Global Music Repository with Synced Listening

# Project Descriptio 
This project is a system that allows users to upload songs to a global repository hosted on Amazon S3 and then create a song group, where anyone present can listen to the songs in sync. The project is built using Node.js, AWS, and Socket.io.

Users can easily upload their songs to the global repository, where they will be stored and made available for listening. The system uses Amazon S3 to ensure reliable and scalable storage of the songs, allowing users to upload and access songs from anywhere in the world.

Once users have uploaded their songs, they can create a song group, which allows them to share their songs with others in real-time. The system uses Socket.io to enable synced listening, ensuring that all users in the song group are listening to the same song at the same time.

The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, allowing anyone to upload and share their songs with others. The project is built using modern web development technologies, including Node.js, AWS, and Socket.io, ensuring reliability and scalability.

This project provides a fun and innovative way for music lovers to share their songs with others and enjoy a synchronized listening experience.
